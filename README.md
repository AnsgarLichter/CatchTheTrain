# Catch the Train

This is my first fullter based app. The target was to create an app to retrieve the data of the KVV (Karlsruher Verkehrsverbund). 
Now you should be able to track the live departures at one or more stations more comfortable.


## Impressions

This section will be added shortly.


## Google Play Store

As soon as the first feature is finished the app will be released in the Google Play Store.


## Features for the future

* Retrieve live data for saved routes
